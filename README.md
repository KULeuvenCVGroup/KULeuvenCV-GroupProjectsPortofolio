# Computer Vision Projects â€“ KU Leuven MSc AI (2024â€“2025)

This repository contains group assignments completed as part of the **Computer Vision (H02A5a)** course in the **Master of Artificial Intelligence** at **KU Leuven** during the 2024â€“2025 academic year.  

The course explored both **classical** and **deep learningâ€“based** approaches to computer vision, with a strong focus on hands-on experimentation, Kaggle competitions, and critical evaluation of methods. Through two group projects, we investigated the design of end-to-end vision pipelines, evaluated their performance, and reflected on their limitations in real-world contexts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Objectives

The course aimed to provide students with:

- A **theoretical foundation** in computer vision concepts, from image formation to advanced recognition tasks.  
- **Practical skills** in implementing and evaluating vision pipelines using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch.  
- Experience in **comparing classical and modern methods**, including handcrafted feature extraction and deep neural networks.  
- Insights into **model robustness and limitations**, with a focus on adversarial examples and the gap between lab performance and real-world deployment.  
- Collaborative experience in **team-based projects**, including report writing, visualization, and competition-driven evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Group Assignments Overview

### 1. Face Recognition with Handcrafted and Learned Features
- Explored **feature construction** for face recognition using both handcrafted descriptors (HOG) and learned features (PCA/eigenfaces).  
- Built classification pipelines to distinguish between visually similar individuals (e.g., Jesse Eisenberg vs. Michael Cera).  
- Extended the pipeline with **deep learningâ€“based embeddings** (VGG-Face) and augmentations for improved robustness.  
- Reflected on strengths and weaknesses of classical vs. deep methods in real-world face recognition.

### 2. In the Name of Deep Learning
- Applied **CNNs** to two major tasks on the PASCAL VOC 2009 dataset:  
  - **Image Classification**: Multi-class recognition of objects using custom CNNs and transfer learning.  
  - **Semantic Segmentation**: Pixel-level classification with encoderâ€“decoder architectures (U-Net).  
- Investigated **Adversarial Attacks** using a CNN adversary to generate perturbations that fooled both classifiers and segmenters.  
- Reflected on the **robustness** of deep learning models and their vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learning Outcomes

- Classical methods (HOG, PCA) provide interpretability and insight into feature construction but lack robustness.  
- Deep learning (CNNs, transfer learning) achieves superior accuracy for both classification and segmentation tasks, but models remain **fragile** under adversarial perturbations.  
- Effective **preprocessing, augmentation, and architecture design** are crucial for performance.  
- **Critical reflection** is as important as accuracy: both assignments required discussing mistakes, limitations, and real-world implications.
